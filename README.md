# Team Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

I created this application to generate an HTML page with a group of team members that will appear on cards in the main body. This application is useful if you want to organize your development team in a clean and easy way.

## Installation

To install this team generator, the user will need to create a clone of this repository by using the command `git clone` in git bash. The user will then have to open this repository in VSCode. The user will have to have node installed on their vscode.  

[For more information on installing npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install)  

The user will then need to open the main directory in the integrated terminal and run the command `npm i` to install the neccessary dependancies for the application to run.
Then to start the application, the user will need to run `node index.js` in the terminal.

## Usage

There is ALREADY a sample HTML file created in this repository. Please delete that file before generating a new one.

- After running `node index.js` the user will be prompted with a series of questions to fill out for the manager position. 

- Upon completion of the manager's questions, the user will see the main menu which contains a list of options, (Add new intern, addnew engineer, or quit). 

- Add engineer will prompt the user with a series of questions about the engineer. Once those questions have been answered, the user will be brought back to the main menu. 

- Add intern will prompt the user with a series of questionsabout the intern. Once those questions have been answered, the will be brought back to the main menu. 

- The quit option will terminate the program and generate an HTML file with all the information the user had answered via the prompted questions.

I have provided a link to a video of me demoing the application installation, usage, and the HTML document that is generated.
